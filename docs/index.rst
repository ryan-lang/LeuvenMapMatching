Leuven.MapMatching's documentation
==================================

Align a trace of coordinates (e.g. GPS measurements) to a map of road segments.

The matching is based on a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) with non-emitting
states. The model can deal with missing data and you can plug in custom
transition and emission probability distributions.
